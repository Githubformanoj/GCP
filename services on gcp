GCP COMPUTE SERVICES ------
compute engine - IAAS
app engine - PAAS
container engine - GOOGLE KUBERNETES SERVICE
container rajistry - WHERE YOU WILL PUSH YOUR CONTAINERS
cloud function - SERVERLESS OFFERING


GCP STORAGE SERVICES -------
cloud storage - unified storage service, its lets you to store data in blocks like images, videos, and structered and unstructered. and its stored in the form of object.
cloud bigtable -  No SQL databases  - we use it for processing the data with low latency.
cloud datastore - No SQL databases - we use it for processing the data in herarical.
cloud SQL - SQL dabase, process Structer data.
persistent disk - Block storage -  always need a host machine to access of its data. we can also attach and detach with our instance.


GCP NETWORKING SERVICES --------


VPC - vpc is a virtual private cloud inside the public cloud its a virtual netwoek for our resources where we can specify ipadd range and subnets gateways and firewall rules.
GCP LOAD BALENCER - a load-balencer distribute user traffic across multiple instances of your application acoriding to the load.
There are 6 types of load balencers in google cloud - 
External - http load balencing, ssl load balencing, TCP proxy load balencing, TCP/UDP network load balencing.
Internal - internal TCP/UDP load balencing, internal http load balencing.

GCP Database -----


Relational database service -- 
Cloud SQL: Cloud SQL is a traditional relational database service that supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. It is designed for vertical scaling, which means you can increase the resources (CPU and RAM) of a single
instance, but it has limitations in terms of horizontal scalability. Scaling up can improve performance, but it has an upper limit.

Cloud Spanner: Cloud Spanner is a globally distributed, horizontally scalable database service. It is designed for high availability and can automatically replicate data across multiple regions. Cloud Spanner provides
both strong consistency and horizontal scaling, making it suitable for globally distributed applications with high transactional requirements.

Key-value database services -------
Cloud Bigtable - Cloud Bigtable is a fully managed, scalable NoSQL database. In a key-value database, data is stored as simple key-value pairs.Each key is associated with a single value, which can be a string,
binary data, or a more complex data structure like JSON. Key-value databases are schema-less, meaning that there is no predefined structure for the data.
often used for caching, session management, and storing simple data structures.designed for horizontal scalability

Document database services -----
Document databases store data in a semi-structured format, typically using documents.Document databases provide richer querying capabilities


GOOGLE BIG TABLE --------
It is a key-value database. used for store large amount of data with low latency. you can increase the number of nodes as per the requirement.
Bigtable is a schema-less NoSQL database, which means you can store and retrieve data without a fixed schema.
Bigtable is a sparse, distributed, multilevel map which indexed by a combination of row ,column and timestamp values.

(row:string, column:string,Timestamp:int64) â†’ string


BIG QUERY ------  It is a serverless database and highly scalable. it can analyge patabytes of data in seconds.BigQuery is serverless, which means you don't need to provision or manage any infrastructure. 
BigQuery uses standard SQL for querying data, BigQuery is known for its high-speed query processing.BigQuery is a data warehouse optimized for running complex SQL queries on large datasets



GOOGLE kUBERNETES ENGINE -------
GKE provides a managed environment for deploying, managing and scaling containerize applications.
process - cloud code -> code repository -> code build -> container rajistery -> -> GKE.


Google file store ----
it is a file storage service procided by google which allows us to create a NFS file server instance and access it or share the filesystem across multiple compute engines.

Cloud Armor -------
Google cloud armor helps you to protect your google cloud deployments, from multiple types of threts. basically it is a firewall service provided by google.


Firebase - cloud based NOSQL database where we can store sink and query our data.
Realtime Database stores data as one big JSON tree, while Cloud Firestore stores it as a collection of documents. 
This means that in Realtime Database, all the data is stored together in a single object, while in Firestore the data is split into smaller chunks called documents. 



Certainly, let me explain what Pub/Sub, Dataproc, Dataflow, and Deployment Manager are in Google Cloud Platform (GCP):

Pub/Sub (Cloud Pub/Sub):

What it is: Google Cloud Pub/Sub is a messaging service that allows you to send and receive messages between independent applications.
How it's used: Pub/Sub enables decoupled communication between different components of an application or different services, making it easier to build scalable, distributed systems.
Example: You can use Cloud Pub/Sub to implement a publish-subscribe pattern for event-driven architectures. For instance, a web application can publish user-generated events, and multiple subscribers can react to these events, such as sending emails, processing data, or updating databases.
Dataproc:

What it is: Google Cloud Dataproc is a fast, easy-to-use, fully managed cloud service for running Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, Apache Hive, and other big data frameworks.
How it's used: Dataproc simplifies the process of creating and managing big data clusters, enabling you to process and analyze large datasets efficiently.
Example: You can use Dataproc to process and analyze log data, run machine learning models, or perform data transformations at scale.
Dataflow (Cloud Dataflow):

What it is: Google Cloud Dataflow is a fully managed stream and batch data processing service based on the Apache Beam model.
How it's used: Dataflow allows you to design and execute data processing pipelines for real-time or batch data processing, making it easier to process, transform, and enrich data.
Example: Dataflow can be used to process and analyze real-time streaming data, such as clickstream data from a website or IoT sensor data. It can also handle batch data transformations, like ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
Deployment Manager:

What it is: Google Cloud Deployment Manager is an infrastructure-as-code service that automates the creation and management of Google Cloud resources.
How it's used: With Deployment Manager, you define the desired state of your infrastructure in a configuration file, and the service creates, updates, and manages resources to match that state.
