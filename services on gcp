GCP COMPUTE SERVICES ------
compute engine - IAAS
app engine - PAAS
container engine - GOOGLE KUBERNETES SERVICE
container rajistry - WHERE YOU WILL PUSH YOUR CONTAINERS
cloud function - SERVERLESS OFFERING


GCP STORAGE SERVICES -------
cloud storage - unified storage service, its lets you to store data in blocks like images, videos, and structered and unstructered. and its stored in the form of object.
cloud bigtable -  No SQL databases  - we use it for processing the data with low latency.
cloud datastore - No SQL databases - we use it for processing the data in herarical.
cloud SQL - SQL dabase, process Structer data.
persistent disk - Block storage -  always need a host machine to access of its data. we can also attach and detach with our instance.


GCP NETWORKING SERVICES --------


VPC - vpc is a virtual private cloud inside the public cloud its a virtual netwoek for our resources where we can specify ipadd range and subnets gateways and firewall rules.
GCP LOAD BALENCER - a load-balencer distribute user traffic across multiple instances of your application acoriding to the load.
There are 6 types of load balencers in google cloud - 
External - http load balencing, ssl load balencing, TCP proxy load balencing, TCP/UDP network load balencing.
Internal - internal TCP/UDP load balencing, internal http load balencing.

GCP Database -----


Relational database service -- 
Cloud SQL: Cloud SQL is a traditional relational database service that supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. It is designed for vertical scaling, which means you can increase the resources (CPU and RAM) of a single
instance, but it has limitations in terms of horizontal scalability. Scaling up can improve performance, but it has an upper limit.

Cloud Spanner: Cloud Spanner is a globally distributed, horizontally scalable database service. It is designed for high availability and can automatically replicate data across multiple regions. Cloud Spanner provides
both strong consistency and horizontal scaling, making it suitable for globally distributed applications with high transactional requirements.

Key-value database services -------
Cloud Bigtable - Cloud Bigtable is a fully managed, scalable NoSQL database. In a key-value database, data is stored as simple key-value pairs.Each key is associated with a single value, which can be a string,
binary data, or a more complex data structure like JSON. Key-value databases are schema-less, meaning that there is no predefined structure for the data.
often used for caching, session management, and storing simple data structures.designed for horizontal scalability

Document database services -----
Document databases store data in a semi-structured format, typically using documents.Document databases provide richer querying capabilities


GOOGLE BIG TABLE --------
It is a key-value database. used for store large amount of data with low latency. you can increase the number of nodes as per the requirement.
Bigtable is a schema-less NoSQL database, which means you can store and retrieve data without a fixed schema.
Bigtable is a sparse, distributed, multilevel map which indexed by a combination of row ,column and timestamp values.

(row:string, column:string,Timestamp:int64) â†’ string


BIG QUERY ------  It is a serverless database and highly scalable. it can analyge patabytes of data in seconds.BigQuery is serverless, which means you don't need to provision or manage any infrastructure. 
BigQuery uses standard SQL for querying data, BigQuery is known for its high-speed query processing.



GOOGLE kUBERNETES ENGINE -------
GKE provides a managed environment for deploying, managing and scaling containerize applications.
process - cloud code -> code repository -> code build -> container rajistery -> -> GKE.
